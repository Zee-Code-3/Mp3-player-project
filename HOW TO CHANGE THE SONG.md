# How To Change The Song
---
## Step one:
Where it says
```python
pygame.mixer.music.load("/Users/amy/Coding-with-C++/Python-mp3-project/free-bird-solo.mp3")
```
change "/Users/amy/Coding-with-C++/Python-mp3-project/free-bird-solo.mp3" to the path for your song like this
```python
"/example/path/song.mp3"
```
## Side note:
make sure it's a ``.mp3`` file not a ``.wav`` file or something else
